# Open Shift Issues

## PostgreSQL permissions error in OpenShift due to incorrect mount path.

### Solution

Set mount path to `/var/lib/postgresql` instead of `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

<summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

The error indicates that the PostgreSQL instance in an OpenShift environment lacks the necessary permissions to access the data directory. The solution is to adjust the mount path in the configuration.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open your PostgreSQL configuration file, typically named `postgresql.yaml` or a similar variation.
2. Locate the `volumeMounts` section.
3. Change the `mountPath` from `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql`. This is because the PostgreSQL image expects the data directory to be a subdirectory of the mount path, not the mount path itself.
4. Save the file and apply the configuration to your OpenShift cluster using the appropriate command, such as `oc apply -f postgresql.yaml`.
5. Verify that the PostgreSQL pod starts without the permissions error.

Note: It was also mentioned that changing the image to `postgres:15-alpine` resolved the issue, which suggests that there might be specific configurations or permissions set in the `alpine` image that are more suited to the OpenShift environment.

Remember to adjust the PostgreSQL deployment configurations to ensure that the data persists across pod restarts and deployments.

## Problem Statement

Difficulty logging into a Red Hat account using university email, with repeated password resets failing to resolve the issue.

### Immediate Solution

Disable any active password manager extensions, and attempt to log in using the email address instead of the user ID.

<summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

#### Context

The user faced challenges accessing their Red Hat account. Despite multiple password resets and receiving confirmation emails, they encountered consistent login failures.

#### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Password Reset Efforts:** The user reset the password several times and received confirmation emails, indicating that the account and email linkage were active.
2. **Account Lock Possibility:** Repeated failed login attempts might lead to a temporary account lock as a security precaution, but this was not explicitly confirmed in this case.
3. **Impact of Password Managers:** The user eventually identified that a password manager (e.g., LastPass) was affecting the login process. Password managers can autofill outdated credentials or interfere with authentication.

#### Solution

- **Disabling Password Manager:** The user succeeded in logging in after disabling the password manager, using the email address for login rather than the user ID.

#### Conclusion

This scenario underscores the need to consider all aspects of the login procedure, including the potential impact of external tools like password managers, which might complicate the authentication process.
